## About

The fourth installment of the Standards, Precautions, and Advances in Ancient Metagenomics (SPAAM4) will take place on 12-14 October 2022. 

\#SPAAM4


## Registration

Register [here](https://tinyurl.com/SPAAM4Reg)

Deadline is September 12, 2022

Registration is required to attend. 

As the number of participants is limited, priority will be given to early-stage researchers e.g. graduate students, postdocs, and new PIs.


## Abstract submission

Submit your abstract [here](https://tinyurl.com/SPAAM4Abs)

The deadline to submit is August 1, 2022

The goal of this conference is to facilitate conversations inspired by the presentations, so we are encouraging talks about methods, challenges, or strategies that you'd like to discuss with a friendly community of peers. It's even fine if you don't have "results" and want to share a work in progress or something you're thinking about. Everyone is encouraged to submit an abstract! 

We care a lot about making SPAAM a diverse place and want to especially encourage applications from people belonging to groups historically excluded from the sciences.
