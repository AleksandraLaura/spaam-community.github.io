# Standards Precautions and Advances in Metagenomics

## About Us
We are a community of researchers focusing on ancient metagenomics.

We aim to regularly meet to share knowledge on solutions to common challenges
and obstacles that the field faces, with cycling organising commitees. We also
collectively run projects for the benefits of the whole community.

We also have a [slack
channel](https://join.slack.com/t/spaam-community/shared_invite/zt-ei8pfw4m-XdBGTQwRaXWrEkd618YlhQ)
for day-to-day advice, help and brainstorming.
