### Event Description

The field of metagenomics is massively expanding our understanding of biological environments. While the increasing sensitivity of modern techniques is enabling the detection of a greater diversity of microbial and eukaryotic taxa at lower abundance, this data-rich discipline comes with many challenges in making sense of these highly dimensional datasets. Ancient metagenomics is no exception, but brings along additional obstacles related to the degraded nature of samples and low sample biomass. Knowledge sharing, distribution, and coordination between archaeo- and palaeogeneticists  is crucial to ensure efficiency in overcoming these challenges.

In this context, we propose a second meeting of the Standards, Precautions and Authentication of Ancient Metagenomics (SPAAM) workshop that [occured in 2016 (Jena, Germany)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-genom-091416-035526) to bring together the ancient microbial genetics community to address the issues raised above. We aim to define the highest priority obstacles in ancient metagenomics, share past-experiences in overcoming and mitigating these obstacles, and guide the development of future solutions and standards in this field. Therefore, PhD and postdoc scholars who are actively analyzing these datasets are our target demographic. In a round-table discussion format, we will cover four main topics: 

1. Biases in ancient metagenomics research
2. Authentication of ancient metagenomics datasets
3. Open and reproducible science
4. Building networks within the ancient metagenomics community

We envision the primary outcome of this workshop to be the establishment of an active, ongoing community for consistent knowledge dissemination and constructive assistance between ancient DNA labs. A major component of this will be creating structured consensus guidelines for optimizing ancient metagenomics wet and dry-lab workflows. In doing so, we aim to keep the field focused and up-to-date in accordance with the advances being made in modern metagenomics research. Secondarily, we aim to write an opinion paper on the status and major challenges of the field that clearly defines standards for these types of studies. A preliminary summary of the workshop will be presented at the closing ceremony of ISBA9. These initiatives should help to consolidate ancient metagenomics as a solid research field connecting both archaeology and the biological sciences.

### Accessbility
While we cannot provide financial support, we aim make the workshop as accessible as possible (babies, children, disabilities etc.). Please let us know what support you may require in the registration form.

### Registration of Interest

The register of interest form is now **CLOSED**. We will be contacting everyone who is interesed in the near future.
