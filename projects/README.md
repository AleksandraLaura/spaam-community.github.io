# Projects

Here we provide a list of projects run by the SPAAM community that to assist in
progressing the field.

## AncientMetagenomeDir

AncientMetagenomeDir is a community curated resource of lists of all published
shotgun-sequenced ancient metagenome samples. It is primarily meant to act as a
reference guide to help point researchers toward any relevent public data for
comparative analysis. It is hoped it will help researchers track growth and
development of the field of ancient metagenomics over time.
